# FHE-RAM: Encrypted Random Access Memory Demonstration

**FHE-RAM** is an experimental prototype demonstrating how to implement fully homomorphic encrypted read/write RAM using [**Poulpy**](https://github.com/phantomzone-org/poulpy) ‚Äî a modular and high-performance backend for lattice-based FHE schemes.

This project is **not** intended as a general-purpose library. It serves as a **research-oriented example** to highlight Poulpy's core features and APIs for secure, encrypted computation.

---

## üß† Purpose

This repository demonstrates how [Poulpy](https://github.com/phantomzone-org/poulpy) can be used to:

* Implement encrypted memory with read/write access.
* Leverage GLWE/GGLWE/GGSW ciphertexts for indexing and control logic.
* Perform non-trivial, stateful homomorphic operations efficiently.

---

## üß± Built With

* [Poulpy](https://github.com/phantomzone-org/poulpy): The core lattice-FHE backend.
* Rust: For performance and memory safety in low-level cryptographic code.

---

## üîç Capabilities

* Simulates a RAM with encrypted address and data lines.
* Supports homomorphic read and write operations.

## üß∞ Installing Dependencies

This example requires a local installation of [Poulpy](https://github.com/phantomzone-org/poulpy).

1. Clone Poulpy into the parent directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phantomzone-org/poulpy ../poulpy
```

2. Build the [spqlios-arithmetic](https://github.com/phantomzone-org/spqlios-arithmetic) backend:

```bash
cd ../poulpy/backend/spqlios-arithmetic
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These steps assume a Linux environment. For other platforms, refer to the [spqlios-arithmetic build guide](https://github.com/tfhe/spqlios-arithmetic/wiki/build).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Example

Run the RAM simulation example with:

```bash
cargo run --release --example fhe-ram
```
